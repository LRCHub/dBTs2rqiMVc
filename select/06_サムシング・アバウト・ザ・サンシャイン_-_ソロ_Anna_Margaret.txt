Wake up to the blue sky
Grab your shades
And let's go for a ride
Breakfast by the ocean
We'll do lunch at Sunset & Vine

Every day's a dream in California
Every night the stars come out to play
Wish that I could always feel this way

There's something about the sunshine, baby
I'm seeing you in a whole new light
Out of this world for the first time, baby
Ohhh it's alright

There's something about the sunshine
There's something about the sunshine

Hollywood rocking
In Malibu we hang out and chill
It's all about the shopping
From Melrose to Beverly Hills

Everywhere's a scene
And now we're in it
I don't wanna paint this town alone
When I see you smile I always feel at home

There's something about the sunshine, baby
I'm seeing you in a whole new light
And it's a breeze with the palm trees swaying
Oh, it's alright

Now that you're here (now that you're here)
It's suddenly clear (suddenly clear)
Sun coming through I never knew
Whatever I do it's better with you
It's better with you

There's something about the sunshine baby (something about it)
I'm seeing you in a whole new light (whole new light)
Out of this world for the first time baby (yeah)
Oh, it's alright (it's alright)

There's something about the sunshine baby (something about it)
I'm seeing you in a whole new light (whole new light)
Out of this world for the first time baby (ohhh)
Oh, it's alright (it's alright)

There's something about the sunshine, baby
I'm seeing you in a whole new light
And it's a breeze with the palm trees swaying
Oh, it's alright
